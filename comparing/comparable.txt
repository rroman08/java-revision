For an array, we can simply call Array.sort, and pass it an array, but as previously
mentioned, the elements in the array, need to implement Comparable.

Types like String, primitive wrapper classes are sortable, that is they do implement
this interface.

The interface declaration in Java:

    public interface Comparable<T> {
        int compareTo(T o);
    }

ANY CLASS THAT IMPLEMENTS THIS INTERFACE NEEDS TO IMPLEMENT THE "compareTo" METHOD.

This method takes one object as an argument, as "o", and compares it to the current
instance, as "this".

    Resulting Value         Meaning
    ===============================
    zero                    0 == this
    negative value          this < o
    positive value          this > o
