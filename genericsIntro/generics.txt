GENERICS INTRODUCTION
=====================

Generics allow us to create classes, to design them, in a general way, without
really worrying about the specific details of the elements they might contain.

Java's ArrayList are an example of a generic class.

We can use an ArrayList for any type of object, because many of the methods on
that class can be applied to any type.


WHAT ARE GENERICS?
==================

Java supports generic types, such as classes, record, and interfaces. It also
supports generic methods.

Regular Class:

    class ITellYou {
        private String field;
    }

Generic Class:

    class YouTellMe<T> {
        private T field;
    }

* T is called a type identifier.

Reference Type      Type Parameter      Variable Name
ArrayList           <String>            listOfString


Many of Java's libraries are written using generic classes and interfaces.
