You want to use nested classes when your classes are tightly coupled, meaning their
functionality is interwoven.

Before JDK16, only static nested classes were allowed to have static methods.

As of JDK16, all four types of nested classes can have static members of any type, including static methods.


4 DIFFERENT TYPES OF NESTED CLASSES
===================================

static nested class:
Declared in class body. Much like a static field, access to this class is through the Class name identifier.

instance or inner class:
Declared in class body. This type of class can only be accessed through an instance of the outer class.

local class:
Declared within a method body.

anonymous class:
Unnamed class, declared and instantiated in same statement.
